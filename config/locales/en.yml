          title: This is the NDS story
            story: "A few months ago, Chumo was accepted into the summer intake
                   of Hacker School, a U.S.-based \"retreat for hackers,\" where
                   budding programmers come together for three months to write
                   code, learn new languages and share industry insights.
                   Whereas the programming boot camp was free to attend, Chumo
                   still needed to find a way to cover her trip costs and buy a
                   new laptop. Excited and determined, the young developer
                   turned to online crowdsourcing platform Indiegogo for funds.
                   She set a target of $4,200 and managed to raise nearly
                   $5,800. All she needed then was a visa to travel to the
                   United States. Alas, this was not to be. As an unmarried
                   adult who was not enrolled at university, Chumo was not
                   eligible for a U.S. tourist visa because she couldn't show
                   sufficient \"social ties\" to Kenya to prove that she was
                   planning to return home after attending Hacker School. But
                   the U.S. consulate's refusal only served to slightly alter
                   the plans of this passionate coder. I thought if I can't go
                   to the hacker school, let me try to bring the school to me.
                   Martha Chumo \"I thought if I can't go to the hacker school,
                   let me try to bring the school to me,\" says Chumo. \"(Let me
                   see) what can I do to start a school here.\" Within minutes
                   of her second visa request denial, on June 4, Chumo was
                   calling her friends to announce that, \"I'm starting a hacker
                   school in Kenya!\" A few days later, she launched another
                   Indiegogo campaign asking people to help her set up her own
                   school for developers in Nairobi. \"I was so frustrated
                   because I had applied to go to Hacker School; I got into it,
                   I raised funds to go there, I had all these plans to read and
                   learn for three months and then I'm not allowed to go --
                   that's how the idea for the school was born.\" ... source
